;; # The Dispatcher

;; This should probably be it's own project as well
;; The Dispatcher.
;; This is the muscle of the bunch.
;; He'll knock ya lights out and leave ya swimmin with the fishes.
;; So don't mess around with him, ya hear?

;; The dispatcher is what gives us control over how events are processed.
;; For most applications, a pretty straightforward mechanism should work.
;; Events should get handled in the order they are fired in.
;; Simple.

;; But suppose you wanted more control over the situation?
;; Perhaps you want for error and/or warning events to be handled with higher priority than other queues of
;; events?
;; Perhaps you are sampling from an input device, and don't want for it's signal to swamp out other important
;; functionality?
;; Perhaps you want to be able to plug in your own crazy rube goldberg core.async pipeline for some malicious
;; scheme against humanity.
;; Perhaps you're mouthing these words as you read this...

;; Dispatchers are based on protocols, so as long as whatever you specify for a dispatcher satisties these
;; protocols (you should look at the DatProtocol github repo...), and you don't code it like a moron, it
;; should work fine.

;; However, we provide for you a few prepackaged dispatchers which should work for the 99%.
